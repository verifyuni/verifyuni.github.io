                I grew up in Malaysia and then moved to India, graduating with a degree in Architecture from the Indian 
                Institute Of Technology. Later, I lived in Singapore and India, training as an educator in the Montessori 
                and Waldorf systems, before relocating to the US where I completed my certification in College Admissions 
                and Career Planning from UC Berkeley. Living and working in Malaysia, Singapore, India and the U.S., while 
                putting two children through school and colleges across countries has given me unique perspective across 
                diverse school curricula and educational systems including the IGCSE, IB and the American high-school 
                programs. I have seen that each student's college application is unique and comes with its own promise and 
                potential. I bring empathy, practical insights and genuine commitment to help each of my students find a 
                college/ university that matches their distinctive background and interests.

                Prior to completing the UC Berkeley College Admissions Advising program, I’ve had a variety of 
                educational and work related experiences that serve me in my everyday work as a college counselor. 
                After graduating from UC Davis (Summa Cum Laude, Psychology and Rhetoric and Communications), 
                I completed a Masters degree in Counseling Psychology from Santa Clara University.  The education and 
                training as a counselor to teens and their families has given me insight into how to best help parents
                 and students as they face the exciting and often stressful college admissions process and the transition 
                 to adulthood. In addition to counseling, I have experience working in public relations, which honed my 
                 writing and marketing skills and at Stanford University, where I developed my research and writing skills,
                  collaborating in a project that resulted in published scientific research.  As a college counselor I 
                  have worked in both a high school setting and as an independent consultant helping students find their 
                  “best fit” schools all over the U.S.  As a mom who has been through the college application process 
                  with my own children, I know the importance of using humor, empathy and compassion in my work with 
                  students and their parents.

                In addition to completing the UC Berkeley College Admissions Advising Program. I received my undergraduate 
                degrees from Pitzer College, (one of the Claremont Colleges). I also hold an MBA in International 
                Management from the Thunderbird School of Global Management (now part of ASU). I spent 20 years working in 
                the corporate world working in Senior Roles in Brand Management, managing brands such as Cover Girl 
                Cosmetics, Nestle Beverages and Dell Computers. I bring this strategic brand management viewpoint in 
                reviewing a student’s file and helping them determine the best way to approach their college admissions 
                process.
                As a stay at home Mom of two daughters I’ve volunteered extensively in the Lafayette School District 
                where I discovered the joy of working with students of all ages. I also recently completed the 
                college search process with my oldest daughter so I’ve had first-hand experience going through the process 
                as a parent. In my spare time I also work at Las Lomas High School in the College and Career Placement 
                office and volunteer as a College Placement advisor for national organizations such as Scholar Match and 
                Matchlighter.  My outside interests include tennis, hiking and being a “college trivia” nerd.
