We consulted many consultants and spoke to various agencies and finally decided on verifyuni for their personal touch and honest approach. They have put in the same amount of hard work that my daughter put and that’s saying something. She got accepted to so many good universities and we owe it to VerifyUni. I would strongly recommend them to every parent who is looking for an exceptional team to help their child get into a good university.\"\n                                                author=\"Shreya Dev - Seattle, USA\"\n                                            />\n                                        </div>\n                                    </div>\n                                </div>\n                            </Carousel>\n                        </Card>\n                    </GridItem>\n                </GridContainer>\n            </div>\n        </div>\n    );\n}\n"],"mappings":";AAAA,OAAOA,KAAK,MAAM,OAAO;AACzB;AACA,OAAOC,QAAQ,MAAM,aAAa;AAClC;AACA,SAASC,UAAU,QAAQ,0BAA0B;AACrD;AACA,OAAOC,UAAU,MAAM,+BAA+B;AACtD,OAAOC,eAAe,MAAM,gCAAgC;AAC5D;AACA,OAAOC,aAAa,MAAM,kCAAkC;AAC5D,OAAOC,QAAQ,MAAM,6BAA6B;AAClD,OAAOC,IAAI,MAAM,yBAAyB;AAC1C,OAAOC,KAAK,MAAM,gCAAgC;AAGlD,OAAOC,KAAK,MAAM,wBAAwB;AAG1C,OAAOC,MAAM,MAAM,yEAAyE;AAE5F,IAAMC,SAAS,GAAGT,UAAU,CAACQ,MAAM,CAAC;AAEpC,eAAe,SAASE,YAAYA,CAAA,EAAG;EACnC,IAAMC,OAAO,GAAGF,SAAS,EAAE;EAC3B,IAAMG,QAAQ,GAAG;IACbC,IAAI,EAAE,IAAI;IACVC,QAAQ,EAAE,IAAI;IACdC,KAAK,EAAE,GAAG;IACVC,YAAY,EAAE,CAAC;IACfC,cAAc,EAAE,CAAC;IACjBC,QAAQ,EAAE;EACd,CAAC;EACD,oBACIpB,KAAA,CAAAqB,aAAA;IAAKC,SAAS,EAAET,OAAO,CAACU,OAAQ;IAAAC,MAAA;IAAAC,QAAA;MAAAC,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;MAAAC,UAAA;MAAAC,YAAA;IAAA;EAAA,gBAC5B7B,KAAA,CAAAqB,aAAA;IAAKC,SAAS,EAAET,OAAO,CAACiB,SAAU;IAAAN,MAAA;IAAAC,QAAA;MAAAC,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;MAAAC,UAAA;MAAAC,YAAA;IAAA;EAAA,gBAClC7B,KAAA,CAAAqB,aAAA;IAAKC,SAAS,EAAET,OAAO,CAACkB,KAAM;IAAAP,MAAA;IAAAC,QAAA;MAAAC,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;MAAAC,UAAA;MAAAC,YAAA;IAAA;EAAA,gBACd7B,KAAA,CAAAqB,aAAA;IAAIC,SAAS,EAAET,OAAO,CAACkB,KAAM;IAAAP,MAAA;IAAAC,QAAA;MAAAC,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;MAAAC,UAAA;MAAAC,YAAA;IAAA;EAAA,GAAC,cAAY,CAAK,CACzC,eAClB7B,KAAA,CAAAqB,aAAA,CAAChB,aAAa;IAAAmB,MAAA;IAAAC,QAAA;MAAAC,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;MAAAC,UAAA;MAAAC,YAAA;IAAA;EAAA,gBACV7B,KAAA,CAAAqB,aAAA,CAACf,QAAQ;IAAC0B,EAAE,EAAE,CAAE;IAACC,EAAE,EAAE,CAAE;IAACC,EAAE,EAAE,CAAE;IAACZ,SAAS,EAAET,OAAO,CAACsB,UAAW;IAAAX,MAAA;IAAAC,QAAA;MAAAC,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;MAAAC,UAAA;MAAAC,YAAA;IAAA;EAAA,gBACzD7B,KAAA,CAAAqB,aAAA,CAACd,IAAI;IAAC6B,QAAQ;IAAAZ,MAAA;IAAAC,QAAA;MAAAC,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;MAAAC,UAAA;MAAAC,YAAA;IAAA;EAAA,gBACV7B,KAAA,CAAAqB,aAAA,CAACpB,QAAQ,EAAAoC,MAAA,CAAAC,MAAA,KAAKxB,QAAQ;IAAAU,MAAA;IAAAC,QAAA;MAAAC,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;MAAAC,UAAA;MAAAC,YAAA;IAAA;EAAA,iBAClB7B,KAAA,CAAAqB,aAAA;IAAAG,MAAA;IAAAC,QAAA;MAAAC,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;MAAAC,UAAA;MAAAC,YAAA;IAAA;EAAA,GAAK,2CAED,eAAA7B,KAAA,CAAAqB,aAAA;IAAKC,SAAS,EAAC,eAAe;IAAAE,MAAA;IAAAC,QAAA;MAAAC,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;MAAAC,UAAA;MAAAC,YAAA;IAAA;EAAA,gBAC1B7B,KAAA,CAAAqB,aAAA;IAAKC,SAAS,EAAET,OAAO,CAAC0B,IAAK;IAAAf,MAAA;IAAAC,QAAA;MAAAC,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;MAAAC,UAAA;MAAAC,YAAA;IAAA;EAAA,gBACzB7B,KAAA,CAAAqB,aAAA;IAAKC,SAAS,EAAET,OAAO,CAAC2B,IAAK;IAAAhB,MAAA;IAAAC,QAAA;MAAAC,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;MAAAC,UAAA;MAAAC,YAAA;IAAA;EAAA,EAAO,eACpC7B,KAAA,CAAAqB,aAAA,CAACb,KAAK;IACFiC,IAAI,EAAC,ogBAAogB;IACzgBC,MAAM,EAAC,gCAAgC;IAAAlB,MAAA;IAAAC,QAAA;MAAAC,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;MAAAC,UAAA;MAAAC,YAAA;IAAA;EAAA,EACzC,CACA,CAEJ,CACJ,eACN7B,KAAA,CAAAqB,aAAA;IAAAG,MAAA;IAAAC,QAAA;MAAAC,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;MAAAC,UAAA;MAAAC,YAAA;IAAA;EAAA,gBACI7B,KAAA,CAAAqB,aAAA;IAAKsB,GAAG,EAAC,EAAE;IAACrB,SAAS,EAAC,aAAa;IAAAE,MAAA;IAAAC,QAAA;MAAAC,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;MAAAC,UAAA;MAAAC,YAAA;IAAA;EAAA,EAAG,eACtC7B,KAAA,CAAAqB,aAAA;IAAKC,SAAS,EAAC,eAAe;IAAAE,MAAA;IAAAC,QAAA;MAAAC,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;MAAAC,UAAA;MAAAC,YAAA;IAAA;EAAA,gBAC9B7B,KAAA,CAAAqB,aAAA;IAAKC,SAAS,EAAET,OAAO,CAAC0B,IAAK;IAAAf,MAAA;IAAAC,QAAA;MAAAC,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;MAAAC,UAAA;MAAAC,YAAA;IAAA;EAAA,gBACrB7B,KAAA,CAAAqB,aAAA;IAAKC,SAAS,EAAET,OAAO,CAAC2B,IAAK;IAAAhB,MAAA;IAAAC,QAAA;MAAAC,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;MAAAC,UAAA;MAAAC,YAAA;IAAA;EAAA,EAAO,eACpC7B,KAAA,CAAAqB,aAAA,CAACb,KAAK;IACFiC,IAAI,EAAC,yWAAyW;IAC9WC,MAAM,EAAC,mCAAmC;IAAAlB,MAAA;IAAAC,QAAA;MAAAC,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;MAAAC,UAAA;MAAAC,YAAA;IAAA;EAAA,EAC5C,CACA,CAEJ,CACJ,eACN7B,KAAA,CAAAqB,aAAA;IAAAG,MAAA;IAAAC,QAAA;MAAAC,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;MAAAC,UAAA;MAAAC,YAAA;IAAA;EAAA,gBACI7B,KAAA,CAAAqB,aAAA;IAAKsB,GAAG,EAAC,EAAE;IAACrB,SAAS,EAAC,aAAa;IAAAE,MAAA;IAAAC,QAAA;MAAAC,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;MAAAC,UAAA;MAAAC,YAAA;IAAA;EAAA,EAAG,eACtC7B,KAAA,CAAAqB,aAAA;IAAKC,SAAS,EAAC,eAAe;IAAAE,MAAA;IAAAC,QAAA;MAAAC,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;MAAAC,UAAA;MAAAC,YAAA;IAAA;EAAA,gBAC9B7B,KAAA,CAAAqB,aAAA;IAAKC,SAAS,EAAET,OAAO,CAAC0B,IAAK;IAAAf,MAAA;IAAAC,QAAA;MAAAC,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;MAAAC,UAAA;MAAAC,YAAA;IAAA;EAAA,gBACrB7B,KAAA,CAAAqB,aAAA;IAAKC,SAAS,EAAET,OAAO,CAAC2B,IAAK;IAAAhB,MAAA;IAAAC,QAAA;MAAAC,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;MAAAC,UAAA;MAAAC,YAAA;IAAA;EAAA,EAAO,eACpC7B,KAAA,CAAAqB,aAAA,CAACb,KAAK;IACFiC,IAAI,EAAC,yqBAAoqB;IACzqBC,MAAM,EAAC,2BAA2B;IAAAlB,MAAA;IAAAC,QAAA;MAAAC,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;MAAAC,UAAA;MAAAC,YAAA;IAAA;EAAA,EACpC,CACA,CACJ,CACJ,CACC,CACR,CACA,CACC,CACd,CACJ;AAEd"},"metadata":{},"sourceType":"module"}
