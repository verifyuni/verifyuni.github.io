They were able to provide invaluable feedback on all aspects, whether the college would be a good fit personality wise, the academic rigor in various colleges, essay requirements and overall whether it would be a good fit for Nikki or not. We were able to rely on them entirely and take decisions on which colleges to shortlist for application, while having a good mix of reach, target and safety schools. Their support throughout the essay process was invaluable - they were extremely patient and were always available to brainstorm, always gave good and honest feedback and areas to improve, and worked with us till essays were of the highest standard.\"\n                                                author=\"Nivedita Bhat - California, USA\"\n                                            />\n                                        </div>\n                                    </div>\n                                </div>\n\n                                <div>\n                                    <img src={image} alt=\"First slide\" className=\"slick-image\" />\n                                    <div className=\"slick-caption\">\n                                        <div className={classes.typo}>\n                                            <div className={classes.note}></div>\n                                            <Quote\n                                                text=\"I can not thank VerifyUni enough. I was pretty late in starting my application process and contacted VerifyUni, even though I was late, I got in a number of universities across the world, some of them very prestigious. It's all because of the time spent with Veena and Ritu ma'am, who helped me throughout the process of my application and still do. I am glad that I went to VerifyUni and nowhere else. It was an amazing experience and I strongly suggest VerifyUni to anyone who's looking to apply to any country. \"\n                                                author=\"Viraj Jaisingh - Jaipur,
